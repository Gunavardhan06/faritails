    <p>A miller once gave a cat to his youngest son.
         The cat said to the youngest son, "Get me a pair of boots, and I will work wonders for you!"
          The surprised youth bought a pair of leather boots for Puss. 
          Puss began taking one animal to the king each day. 
          The king was very impressed. One day, Puss saw the king and the princess driving along. 
          He told his master to bathe in the river and hid his clothes. 
          When the king's carriage neared, Puss shouted that some robbers had stolen the duke's clothes, and left him to drown!
           The king told his attendants to save him and give him fine clothes. 
           He looked so dashing that the king let his daughter marry the youth! </p>

    Everyone is stranded inside the house, after a violent storm and flood occurs. 
    During this chaotic time, Hulbrand and Undine fall in love. 
    Undine has a very precocious personality and at times, appears to have control over the weather. 
    A priest named Father Heilmann is thrown overboard and finds himself at the fishermans house.
     Soon after, Hulbrand asks the priest to marry him and Undine immediately.
     Father Heilmann agrees to marry the young couple.
     The day after the wedding, and Undines demeanor is different than it was before.
      Shes softer, kind, and gentle. 
      Undine explains to her new husband, Hulbrand, that elemental beings exist and that she is in fact, a water spirit. 
      She then goes on to explain that water spirits do not have souls, and can only obtain a soul by marrying a human. 
      Undine further explains, that her parents sent her to go live among humans, in the hopes that she can gain a soul that way and that her marriage to Hulbrand has fulfilled that promise. 
      Undine fears that Hulbrand will abandon her, once he learns the truth about her, but instead, he promises to never leave her. 
      The flood begins to recede, so Hulbrand and Undine decide to depart to Hulbrands home.
       During their journey, they come across Kuhleborn, a shape-shifting water spirit and Undines uncle.
        Undine becomes frightened and begs her uncle to leave them alone, so they can proceed on their journey.
       Hulbrand attempts to attack Kuhleborn, but Kuhleborn vanishes into the waterfall.

        When Hulbrand arrives home, hes greeted with a warm welcome and so is Undine.
         Bertalda is deeply upset to discover that Hulbrand is married to another woman and decides to become friends with Undine.
          One day, Kuhleborn comes to visit Undine and tells her that Bertalda real parents are her foster parents, the fisherman and his wife.
       
          Bertalda is the child, that they had believed to have drowned, but had not.
            Bertalda is devastated and humiliated to learn that her real family is poor and that she isnt of noble descent. 
           She publicly humiliates Undine, by calling her a witch. Undines theory is proven correct by Bertalda birthmarks. 

After learning of Bertaldas horrible behavior towards Undine, both her foster parents and her biological parents disown her, leaving her destitute and desperate. 
Bertalda goes to Undine and begs for forgiveness. Undine accepts her apology and allows her to be remain a guest at her home, where sparks fly once more between Bertalda and Hulbrand, leading to tensions and drama amongst Undine, Bertalda, and Hulbrand.
